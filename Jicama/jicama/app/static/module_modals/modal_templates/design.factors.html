            Factors may arise from continuous variables, like age, weight, blood volume, or length, through categorization into groups. Age for example might be coded in terms of ranges like weaning, pre-puberty, adolescence, adult, and old-age periods.

            Controlling as much of the variation in your outcome measure as possible is key to reliable study results. A sound experimental design accounts for variability that arises from known nontreatment factors, such as sex, weight, or litter, by blocking. If you randomly assign subjects to treatment and control groups without regard for a factor that is known (or suspected) to impact the outcome measure, you may not be able to determine if the treatment or this nontreatment (sometime called <i>confounding</i/> or <i>fixed</i>) factor is the source of an observed difference.
            <br><br>
            A randomized blocked experimental design begins with groups by factors, such as two sex groups for males and females. Within each of these two sex groups, subjects are randomly assigned to treatment levels and control. This design allows you to separate the treatment effects from the potential effects of sex on the outcome measure.

            Nontreatment factors are properties of the subjects that may introduce additional variation in the outcome measure. To minimize the number of subjects required, experimentalists group similar subjects together by their nontreatment factor levels, rather than randomly assigning subjects to treatment settings regardless of their nontreatment factor levels.  One could, for example, accidentally assign all male subjects to the treatment and all females to the control, thus confounding any positive outcome, as the result might be due to variations arising from sex instead of the treatment. This process of "blocking" helps disambiguate positive outcomes from nontreatment based variations.

            Categorical factors are discrete variables.  For example, subject weight can be a (categorical) factor -- low, medium, and high as levels.  Some factors might be:
