    <p>
        Data should be in a comma-separated values format. The first columns should be factors, coded with numeric values (e.g., 0 for males, 1 for females, or 1 for low dose, 2 for high dose, 3 for control). The last column of data should be the outcome measure on which you're doing analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        To obtain a template CSV file, you can go to the <a ui-sref="tools.sims">Simulations tool</a> and generate one. Replace the simulated data with your data. Also, the simulated data assumes a balanced design (all groups have the same number of subjects), so you can delete rows from the template file if you don't have the same number of subjects in each group.
