    <p>
        A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for an observed phenomenon. 
        
        It should be a clear statement that relates to your outcome measure, your treatments and/or manipulations, 
        and potentially any other factors or covariates involved in your study population. 
        
        It is impossible to design a good experiment without a well-defined scientific hypothesis.

    <p>
        Your hypothesis statement will not necessarily conform to the language of statistical hypothesis testing. 
        Statistical hypothesis testing is typically phrased in terms of two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis 
        and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis can be viewed as the treatment or manipulation having no 
        effect on the values of the outcome measure. 
        
        The scientific hypothesis is usually that the treatment will have an effect, and so it typically aligns with 
        the statistical alternative hypothesis.
