            Controlling an experiment involves a separate group from the experimental group, in which no treatment is applied. Control groups are important to help reduce the outside variables (such as environmental or genetic variables) interferring or affecting the outcome of a measured response. 
        </p><br>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Negative Control </h5>
        <p>
            No effects are expected. That is, ensure there is no effect when there <i>should</i> be no effect.  The most common example is a placebo group.
        </p>

        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Positive Control </h5>
        <p>
            An effect is expected. This control type is often used to assess sensitivity or test validity.
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Comparative Control </h5>
        <p>
            A positive control with a known treatment that can be directly compared to a different treatment.  In a drug study, a positive control group might use an existing medication that is known to work, while the experimental group would use the treatment (new drug).
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Sham Control </h5>
        <p>
            Mimics a procedure or treatment, but doesn't actually use the treatment. An example of this is mimicking surgery with the intent being to isolate the effects of surgery from the effects of pre-operative and post-operative care. 
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Vehicle Control </h5>
        <p>
            Suppose a study uses some substance (e.g. saline) as a vehicle for a treatment. The vehicle control group then will not receive the treatment, but will be administered the substance in the same manner as the experimental group. The purpose of this type of control is to determine whether the vehicle itself causes any effects. 
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Na&iuml;ve Control</h5>
        <p>
            Subjects in this group do not receive any treatments. 
        </p>
        
        <h5 class="text-grey text-bold">Wild Type control</h5>
        <p>
            When the treatment or manipulation is a genetic variation or mutation, wild type subjects may provide the appropriate comparator for a controlled experiment.
