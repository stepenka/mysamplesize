            A paired T-test is a statistical test to compare two separate measurements made from the same subjects, for example the lengths of arms on the left and right side of each patient or the blood sugar level of each patient at five minutes and one hour after treatment.

            The key indication of paired T-test applicability is that you have two measurements from each subject. The scientific hypothesis typically asserts that there is a difference between the two measures, while the statistical null hypothesis is that the population mean difference is 0. The paired T-test is the simplest type of repeated measures test.

            To design an experiment using the paired T-Test, four quantities are necessary: 
            the <standard-deviation></standard-deviation> of the difference in measures, 
            the <significance></significance>,
            the <power></power>,
            and the <effect-size></effect-size>.
            All of these are discussed above in the Overview section. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to emphasize that <standard-deviation></standard-deviation> here is the standard deviation of the difference, not of the individual outcome measure. 
            
            The <effect-size></effect-size> here represents the smallest true difference that would be scientifically relevant or interesting.

            A water resource researcher is interested in Zinc contaminant concentrations affecting a local pond. She hypothesizes that, across the area of the pond, differences exist between concentration near the surface and near the bottom.  To study this conjecture, she proposes to collect data from a variety of locations around the pond, obtaining samples from near the surface and near the bottom.

            After discussions with colleagues and research on water quality standards, a true difference of 0.06 mg/L is thought to be a practically relevant effect size.  From a pilot study, she estimates that the standard deviation of surface/bottom concentration differences is approximately 0.08 mg/L. Applying the commonly used values of 0.05 for significance and 0.80 for power, MySampleSizeâ€™s Sample Size tool indicates that a sample size of 16 pairs of concentration measurements from surface and bottom will meet specifications.
