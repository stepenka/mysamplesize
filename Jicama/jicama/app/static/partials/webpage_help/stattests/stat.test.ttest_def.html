            T-tests are among the most basic and widely-used statistical hypothesis tests. Developed by Gossett in 1908 at the Guiness Brewery in Dublin, Ireland, t-tests allow the comparison of a sample of data with a hypothesized mean value and the comparison of two distinct samples.

            The t-statistic on which the test is based is a simple ratio of “signal to noise,” where “signal” denotes the difference between mean values and “noise” denotes the standard error or variability in the mean difference that arises from variability in the subjects and from measurement errors.
