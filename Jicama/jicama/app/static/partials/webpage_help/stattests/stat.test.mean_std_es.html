            The <b>Mean</b>, &mu;, is a central value of the outcome measures over a population of possible subjects. Roughly speaking, outcome measures of individual subjects depart from the mean, some by a little, others by a lot, but overall the mean value tends to be in the middle of the distribution of outcomes. When you collect a sample of subject outcome measures and average them, you are estimating the mean.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientific conjectures about treatments, manipulations, or experimental condition settings are usually thought of in terms of differences in the mean of the outcome measure caused by the treatments.

            <b>Standard deviation</b>, &sigma;, is a measure of how much dispersion or spread the population outcomes have about the mean. Roughly speaking, the standard deviation is the average distance from the individual outcome measures to the population mean.  The value of the standard deviation must usually be estimated through pilot experiments, but literature from related experiments may also be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that the mean and standard deviation have the same units as the outcome measure they are used to model.

            <b>Effect size</b>, &delta;, is a measure of the difference in mean values. The exact definition of this quantity is context-dependent.  If you have two groups representing a control and a treatment condition, the effect size is the difference in the means of the control and treatment populations. If you have multiple treatment groups (say control, low dose, moderate dose, and high dose), then there is not a single number that can represent the differences among all these group population means. In this situation, we use the standard deviation of the group population means as a measure of how different they are.  If all means are equal, then the effect size will be zero.

            For more complex experiments having multiple treatment types or additional factors, please see the more detailed help on effect size.

            Effect size is not a number that statistics tells you; rather, this quantity must be selected within the scientific context of the study. This number can be difficult to come up with, and you should think carefully about what value makes sense for your study. 
            
            Pilot data may help, but more often you must think very hard about how small of true difference would matter to your subjectsâ€™ outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Effect size, like standard deviation, has the same units as does the outcome measure. Some references and software packages use a (unitless) <i>relative effect size</i>, which is the effect size divided by the standard deviation. 
            
            As discussed in Lenth (2001), we prefer the effect size in the units of the outcome measure, as this approach frames the question in terms of units that are scientifically relevant.
