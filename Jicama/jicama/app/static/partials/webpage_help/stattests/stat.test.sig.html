            When you specify a significance of 0.05 (or 5%), here’s what that means. Suppose your scientific conjecture is false (i.e. your treatment is not effective). If you repeat the experiment many times, about 5% of the repetitions would show a positive result, just due to random chance and biological variation.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two possible problems with the results of an experiment. One is “you got lucky,” meaning your findings appear positive due to random chance rather than a real effect. Such a finding is called a false positive. <b>Significance</b> measures this likelihood.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it is common to choose 0.05 for significance level, you should think very carefully about an appropriate value for your experiment.  When performing multiple hypothesis tests from a single data set, for example, the chances of at least one-false-positive-detection go up with the number of tests.

            Power measures an alternative possibility. Let’s say you’ve selected 0.80 (or 80%) power. Here’s what that means. Suppose your scientific conjecture is actually true (i.e. your treatment is effective). After many repetitions, about 80% of the results would back up your conjecture and show a positive result (while 20% would fail to provide the evidence you were hoping for).
        </p>
        <p>
            Does a finding appear positive in the presence of a real underlying effect?  Here the reality is that the treatment and control do have a true difference. <b>Power</b> is the probability of finding a true positive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common to choose 80% power in NIH proposals, but like significance this value also requires some thought. You should choose at least 0.80 if not larger, and you must absolutely report the choice you made.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, the interpretation of significance and power connects with the underlying truth, which you don’t know (or you wouldn’t be doing experiment in the first place). However, some reasoning about the truth is necessary to plan to guard against the risk of errors in evaluating results.
