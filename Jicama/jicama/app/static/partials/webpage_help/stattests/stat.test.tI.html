            An independent-samples T-test is a statistical test to compare a single outcome measure that is collected from two separate, independent groups of subjects. Typically these groups correspond to a control condition and an experimentally-specified (e.g., treatment) condition.

            As opposed to the paired T-test, each subject provides only one measure, but the individual subjects belong to two distinct groups. The question of interest is whether or not the means of the two groups are different or equal.

            A typical independent-samples experiment involves randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups. All of the subjects each group receive the same treatment, manipulation, or experimental condition, but the treatment for the first group is different from that of the second.  A common experiment involves a placebo treatment for one group and an experimental treatment for the second.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another type of independent-samples study might consider how subjects having two different characteristics respond to a single treatment or manipulation.

            To design an experiment using the independent-samples T-Test, four quantities are necessary: 
            the <standard-deviation></standard-deviation> of the measures, 
            the <significance></significance>,
            the <power></power>,
            and the <effect-size></effect-size>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <standard-deviation></standard-deviation> here is the standard deviation of the outcome measure. A complication in the analysis of independent-samples data is the possibility that the different treatments (or different subject characteristics) making for the grouping have different standard deviations for the outcome measure. MySampleSize assumes both standard deviations are the same. If you suspect you have different standard deviations, please contact us for consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <effect-size></effect-size> represents the smallest true difference between the two independently-sampled groups that would be scientifically relevant or interesting.

            A researcher is investigating two distinct medicines for treating high levels of LDL cholesterol in middle aged male patients. By researching the literature, the researcher estimates the standard deviation at 25 mg/dl.  He feels that a difference of 10 mg/dl is the minimal clinically relevant difference of interest. To determine the number of subjects in the two treatment groups, he must also specify significance and power.  He chooses a significance of 0.01 to keep the false positive rate low, and he also wants a power of 0.90 to feel confident in true positive detection.  
        </p>
        <p>
            MySampleSize recommends 188 subjects per group or 376 total subjects. The researcher must recruit 376 patients, whom he will randomly assign into the two groups for the different medicines.
