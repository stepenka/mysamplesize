            A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical test to compare a single outcome measure that is collected in the presence of at least two distinct factors. Factors can represent treatments (with settings chosen by the experimenter) or other biological properties like sex or age.

            Two-way ANOVA is used for experiments that have two different types of treatments, or a treatment that may affect male and female subjects differently. The number of distinct experimental groups is equal to the product of the number of levels of the factors. To illustrate, an experiment with a control and three dosages for a treatment that may impact male and female subjects differently, we will need 4x2 = 8 groups of subjects.

            One common use of two-way ANOVA is investigating treatments for injuries. One factor is the severity of the injury, and the other is the dosage of treatment. Another use of two-way ANOVA might arise when applying two treatments simultaneously to investigate possible synergies.
        </p>
        <p>
            2x2 ANOVA is a very common design: two factors, each of which has two levels, lead to a four-group design. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The <standard-deviation></standard-deviation> here is the standard deviation of the outcome measure. Again there is the possibility that the different treatments (or different subject characteristics) making for the grouping have different standard deviations for the outcome measure. MySampleSize assumes both standard deviations are the same. If you suspect you have different standard deviations, please contact us for consultation.
        </p>

            The <effect-size></effect-size> for two-way ANOVA is even more complicated than it is for one-way. There are three distinct hypothesis that could be investigated: with two-way ANOVA, we have to think about the main factor, the secondary factor, and the interaction between the two.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In a two-way ANOVA, we think of the population mean as broken up into a number of additive terms. The first term is a grand mean, like in one-way ANOVA. The second term is an additive adjustment to the grand mean arising from the main factor’s influence, and the third term is another additive adjustment accounting for the secondary factor’s influence. Finally there is an interaction term that models the joint effect of the two factors working in concert (or opposition). 
            
            Thus, a two-way ANOVA study may involve three distinct statistical hypotheses: the main factor has no impact on the outcome, the secondary factor has no impact, and the two factors have no interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the purposes of defining the effect sizes for these hypotheses, we detail the ANOVA math model:
            <div katex>
                Y_{ijk} = \mu + \eta_i + \zeta_j + \gamma_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}, \quad 
                    1 \leq i \leq a,
                    1 \leq j \leq b,
                    1 \leq k \leq n
            </div>
            in which
            <ul>
                <li> <katex>\mu</katex> is the grand mean</li>
                <li> 
                    <katex>\eta_i</katex> are the main factor adjustments (and it is assumed 
                    <katex>\sum_{i=1}^a \eta_i = 0</katex>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <katex>\zeta_j</katex> are the secondary factor adjustments (and it is assumed 
                    <katex>\sum_{i=1}^b \zeta_i = 0</katex>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <katex>\gamma_{ij}</katex> are the interaction adjustments (and it is assumed 
                    <katex>\sum_{k=1}^a \gamma_{kj} = 0, \sum_{l=1}^b \gamma_{il} = 0, \forall i,j</katex> )
                </li>
                <li> <katex>\varepsilon_{ijk}</katex> are the random fluctuations arising from the subject-to-subject variation.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The effect sizes for the main factor, secondary factor, and interaction hypotheses are as follows:
            <div katex>
                f_M^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^a (\eta_i - \bar{\eta})^2}{a-1}  \quad \text{or} \quad
                f_S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^b (\zeta_i - \bar{\zeta})^2}{b-1} \quad \text{or} \quad
                f_I^2 = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^b \sum_{i=1}^a (\gamma_{ij} - \bar{\gamma})^2}{(a-1)(b-1)}
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again it is worth remembering that different software packages and reference materials may have different conventions.  The following relationships connect effect size here with the relative effect sizes of G*Power:
            
            <div katex>
                \begin{aligned}
                    \text{MainEffectSize}_{\text{MySampleSize}} &= 
                        \sigma \cdot \text{MainEffectSize}_{\text{G*Power}} \sqrt{ \frac{a}{a-1} } \\
                    \text{SecEffectSize}_{\text{MySampleSize}} &= 
                        \sigma \cdot \text{SecEffectSize}_{\text{G*Power}} \sqrt{ \frac{b}{b-1} } \\
                    \text{InterEffectSize}_{\text{MySampleSize}} &= 
                        \sigma \cdot \text{InterEffectSize}_{\text{G*Power}} \sqrt{ \frac{ab}{(a-1)(b-1)} } \\
                \end{aligned}
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Consideration of the main factor and secondary factor effect sizes is similar to that of the one-way ANOVA. In particular, one can apply the conservative divide-by-6 rule of thumb for these by thinking about the difference between the means of the outcome measures of the groups with the largest response and smallest response to the main factor or secondary factor. Or, if appropriate, the “equal spacing” rule of thumb takes the difference between largest and smallest group means for the outcome measure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interaction effect size takes a little more thought. In the case of two manipulations operating in opposition (like an injury and a treatment or a deleterious drug and a counteractive treatment), one might try to imagine the amount of recovery, in terms of a percentage, that would be scientifically important, and apply percentage to the effect size for the injury.  For example, if recovery of 40% of the loss from an injury is the minimal clinically relevant effect, then multiply the effect size of the injury by 0.40.

            A researcher is interested in the potential moderating effect of a peptidase inhibitor on traumatic brain injury (TBI).  To test the impact, the researcher uses an outcome measure of the time in seconds required by the subjects to negotiate a Morris water maze. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Simulating TBI in rats requires a surgical procedure allowing the insertion of a percussive shock instrument into the brain. The experimental design is two treatments: the application of percussive shock to the subjects and the injection of the peptidase inhibitor.

            Each treatment has an associated control. The percussive shock relies on a “sham” surgery, in which the subjects receive the surgical procedure but not the shock. The peptidase inhibitor control is a saline vehicle injection control. Each treatment has two levels, control and treatment, leading to a two-way ANOVA statistical model with four groups total.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The question of interest here is whether or not the pepsidase inhibitor treatment counteracts the impact of the TBI.  Thus, the hypothesis test of interest is about the interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preliminary studies led to an estimated outcome measure standard deviation of 8 seconds, and subjects with no injury or treatment averaged about 10 seconds, while injured subjects averaged about 50 seconds. The loss of 40 seconds estimates the injury effect size. 
            
            A twenty percent recovery would mean an effect size of roughly 8 seconds for the interaction term. To detect an 8 second interaction with 5% significance and 80% power would require 9 subjects per group and 36 subjects total over 4 groups.
