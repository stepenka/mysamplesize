            <b>ANOVA</b>, or <b>AN</b>alysis <b>O</b>f <b>VA</b>riance, is a collection of tools that expand T-tests to more complicated experimental situations. You may want to run an experiment that doesn’t just have a treatment and control but instead has multiple dosages of a treatment and a control.  You may want to test a treatment when subjects may have a condition with different levels of severity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            T-tests have one or two groups of subjects.  A paired T-test involves a single group of subjects from which two measures are obtained, and an independent-samples T-test has two groups of subjects. One important aspect of ANOVA is that is allows you to test 3 or more groups. 
            
            If you only have two groups, ANOVA and an independent-samples T-Test are equivalent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ANOVA not only allows for more than two groups of subjects to be compared, you can also look at multiple factors simultaneously.  That is, you can apply two different treatments, each with its own control and dosage settings. Alternatively, you can apply a treatment and examine the differences in response for male and female subjects.
        </p>

            Within the ANOVA context, the word “way” refers to the different <b>factors</b> or “dimensions” considered. One-way or one-factor ANOVA is used for a single treatment, manipulation, or population structural factor, while three-way ANOVA has three distinct factors (e.g., a condition with several levels of severity, a treatment with multiple dosages, and sex as a factor, males and females).  
        </p>
        <p>
            Each treatment factor is like a different knob you can turn, with levels being the control and settings (e.g. dosages) you can select.  The number of levels for a treatment factor is the number of treatment settings plus 1 for the control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-treatment factors are like a jar filled with marbles (subjects), with different colors representing the levels of the factor.  Conceptually, the distinction between treatment and non-treatment factors focuses on whether the experimenter chooses the settings (treatment) or the levels are properties of the subjects.  The practical difference is that treatment factors include a control in addition to the dosage settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is common in multi-way (or multi-factor) situations to refer to a main factor, secondary factor, tertiary factor, etc, ordering factors in terms of experimental interest.
