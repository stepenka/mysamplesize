            A one-sample T-test is used when the researcher has a predetermined hypothetical population mean value to compare to a single sample of data collected from subjects.  This test is often used in statistics texts as a simple introduction to hypothesis testing, but in practice it typically arises as the analysis method for a paired T-Test.
