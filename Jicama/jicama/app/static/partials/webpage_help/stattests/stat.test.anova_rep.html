            Repeated measures ANOVA generalizes the standard ANOVA structures by allowing multiple measurements (usually over time) from each subject. The paired T-test is a form of repeated measures.

            Much of the same machinery of ANOVA (like effect size definitions) is applicable to repeated measures ANOVA studies.  The major difference is that measurements taken from the same subject are potentially correlated, so the repetition factor must be analyzed fundamentally differently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The three most commonly used repeated measures designs are (1) the pre-post design, (2) the longitudinal design, and (3) the cross-over design.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a pre-post design, subjects are assessed before and after exposure to a manipulation or treatment. In its simplest form, with only one setting for the treatment and no relevant other factors, this design leads to a paired T-test analysis.  If the treatment has multiple levels, then an ANOVA structure is required for analysis.

            Longitudinal designs in repeated measures studies typically involve collecting the outcome measure at a fixed set of times for each subject.  This study design also assumes that exactly one treatment setting (or the control) is applied to each subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cross-over design differs from the longitudinal designs in that each subject receives each treatment setting plus the control.  One of the primary challenges of cross-over experiments is the potential impact of sequencing and carry-over effects.  Sequencing is handled by grouping subjects and applying the treatment in different order. 
            
            For example, if the design has a control, a low dose, and a high dose, the experimenter might choose three groups.  These groups receive treatment in these orders:  group 1 gets control, low, high; group 2 gets low, high, control; and group 3 gets high, control, low. 
            
            This type of design is called a latin square design.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Carry-over concerns the problem of a treatment continuing to impact the subject at the next treatment application: for example, in group 3 above the high dose may not have cleared the subject when the control is applied.  Generally speaking, experimentalists must plan for an adequate wash-out period to allow subjects to recover from the treatment.

            Cross-over studies can be very difficult to design in the presence of multiple factors. MySampleSize can help you with a latin squares layout for studies that have a single factor. If you need to design a cross-over experiment with more than one factor, please contact us directly.

            As with the previous statistical tests, power, significance, standard deviation, and effect size specifications are needed to determine the number of subjects required for statistical hypothesis testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In repeated measures ANOVA, the standard deviation of the outcome measure needs to be split into two components: the within-subjects standard deviation and the between-subjects standard deviation. The former measures the amount of variation in the outcome measure due to measurement error. The latter measures the variation in the outcome measure whose source is subject-to-subject variability. The standard deviation for single measure experiments is a “root sum of squares” combination of these two standard deviations,

                \sigma = \sqrt{ \sigma_{\text{between}}^2 + \sigma_{\text{within}}^2 }
            </div>
            and it is important to study design that you segregate these two sources of variation for repeated measures studies.  Repeated measures analyses allow you to reduce the total variation by averaging out some of the within-subjects variation with multiple measurements over time, thus potentially reducing the number of subjects required for a study, but to determine an appropriate sample size you will need estimates for both of these quantities.

            The <effect-size></effect-size>s for repeated measures ANOVA are very much analogous to those of two-way and three-way ANOVA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hypothesis tests of interest, like with the multi-way ANOVA studies, involve main and secondary factors and interactions. The new issues are (1) time as a factor, and (2) time-treatment interactions. Generally speaking, however, most studies focus on treatment effectiveness rather than temporal effects.
