    {term:'ANOVA', def:'ANalysis Of VAriance. A statistical technique for testing for differences among groups of similarly treated experimental units.'},
    {term:'Correlation', def:'A mutual relationship or connection between two variables. For example; height and weight.'},
    {term:'Covariance', def:'A measure to the degree to which two variables vary together.'},
    {term:'Factor', def:'A categorical variable controlled by the researcher that can be used to quantify a source of variability in the experiment.'},
    {term:'Covariate', def:'A covariate is a continuous variable corresponding to a characteristic of the subject.'},
    {term:'Nonparametric', def:'A statistic that does not rely on the assumptions of a frequency distribution.'},
    {term:'p-value', def:'Probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as a given data point, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This value is always a function of sample size and effect size.'},
    {term:'Response', def:'A quantity measured by the researcher that reflects a subject\'s response to the experimental intervention. Responses can be continuous, discrete, ordinal, nominal, or binary.'},
    {term:'Sample Size', def:'The number of experimental units in an experiment.'},
    {term:'Effect Size', def:'The magnitude of the difference between two groups.'},
    {term:'Power', def:'The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false; i.e. the ability of a test to detect an effect.'},
    {term:'Standard Deviation', def:'A statistical measure of variability of a random quantity.'},
    {term:'Type I Error', def:'The incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis (a false positive); i.e., detecting an effect that is not present.'},
    {term:'Type II Error', def:'The incorrect failure to reject a false null hypothesis.'},
    {term:'T-Test', def:'A statistical test used to determine if the mean of 2 groups are statistically different from one another.'},
    {term:'Regression', def:'A statistical technique for analyzing the effect of one or more independent variables on an outcome measure.'},
    {term:'General Linear Model (GLM)', def:'A statistical model that linearly relates factors, treatments, and covariates to outcomes.  The general linear model encompasses most experimental designs, including ANOVA and dose-response studies.'},
    {term:'Completely Randomized Design', def:'A design involving a single factor assigned to the experimental unit randomly.'},
    {term:'Randomized Block Design', def:'A blocked design in which individuals from each block are randomly assigned to each treatment group.'},
    {term:'Incomplete Block Design', def:'A block design in which every block does not have every treatment applied.'},
    {term:'Crossover Design', def:'A randomized block design where time is the blocking group.'},
    {term:'Latin Square Design', def:'A design consisting of two blocking factors.'},
    {term:'Matched Pair Design', def:'A randomized block design where two treatments are applied to subjects, grouped in pairs.'},
    {term:'Factorial Design', def:'A design in which a researcher controls the variability of two or more discrete independent variables.'},
    {term:'Dose Response Design', def:'A design used to observe the effects of a continuous increasing level of a variable on a measured response.'},
    {term:'Dose Escalation Design', def:'Similar to a dose response design, except all doses are given to each subject over time in an increasing, non-random order (repeated measure).'},
    {term:'Nested Design', def:'A factorial design with a hierarchy.'},
    {term:'Repeated Measures Design', def:'Designs in which a researcher records multiple responses on the experimental unit.'},
    {term:'Sequential Design', def:'Sequential designs are experiments where the treatment is applied in a stepwise, or sequential, method and at each time period the results are analyzed before the next time period begins.'},
    {term:'Blinding', def:'A blind experiment is an experiment in which information is kept from the subjects and/or testers in order to reduce bias.'},
    {term:'Experimental Unit', def:'The smallest division of experimental material such that any two experimental units can receive different treatments (typically an individual subject).'},
    {term:'Observational Unit', def:'The smallest unit that a response will be measured from (often, but not always, the same as the experimental unit).'},
    {term:'Control', def:'A separate group or experimental unit to minimize the impact of effects other than treatments on the statistical analysis of experimental outcomes. '},
    {term:'Blocked Design', def:'An experimental design in which experimental units are organized into blocks by the similarity of characteristics (such as sex), so that the impact of these characteristics can be properly analyzed.'},
