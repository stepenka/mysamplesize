            The tutorial example is a case study on drug effectiveness. The example used throughout this            tutorial comes from a published study on the effect of a drug on acute neuronal degeneration after traumatic brain injury in rats. This study contains 1 Treatment that has 4 levels (1 control and 3 varying dosages of the drug). The information of this study is summarized below but the full details can be found under Case 1 in the <a ui-sref="help.case"><b>Case Studies</b></a> section of the Help pages.

            <li>Research Question</li>
            <p class="padding-left-1em">
                What are the effects of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Agonist ( DCG-IV ) on acute neuronal degeneration after traumatic brain injury in rats.
            </p>
            <li>Objective</li>
            <p class="padding-left-1em">
                The role of metabotropic glutamate receptor activation after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not well understood. In vitro studies suggest that activation of Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors may provide some degree of neuroprotection and may be potential targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Thus, we examined the effects of a Group II selective agonist on neuronal degeneration after in vivo TBI.
            </p>
            <li>Hypothesis</li>
            <p class="padding-left-1em">
                Pharmacological activation of Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors with compound DCG-IV will reduce neuronal cell degeneration measured at 24 hours after experimental TBI in rats.
            </p>
            <li>Methods</li>
            <p class="padding-left-1em">
                Rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: Artificial CSF Vehicle control, 20 fmol DCG-IV, 100 fmol DCG-IV, 500 fmol DCG-IV.
            </p>
            <li>Measured Response</li>
            <p class="padding-left-1em">
                A count of fluoro-jade positive neurons. Degenerating cells were counted in 4 coronal sections in the hippocampus were in a 1.5 mm block of brain tissue.
