    A simple independent-samples T-Test is used to compare a treatment group with a control group. Consider the T statistic's distribution under the null and alternative hypotheses. The T statistic is the difference in sample means over the standard error of that difference. Under the null hypothesis, the T distribution is centered at 0, as the null assumption is that there is no difference in treatment and control means.

    Under the alternative, the distribution is a non-central T whose center depends on the effect size, standard deviation, significance level, and sample size. Use the slider bar to see the impact on the true positive (alternative) distribution and the power of the test.
