            Significance (<i>&alpha;</i>) is the probability of finding a false positive, which is also 
            called a Type I Error.

        <p><strong>
            Significance is one of two important error probabilities that must balanced when designing an experiment.

            Generally speaking, scientific hypotheses concern a causal relationship between a treatment or manipulation and an outcome. Experiments are conducted to build evidence for (or against) a scientific hypothesis. Since the burden of proof for the scientific conjecture is on the scientist, we phrase this process statistically in terms of the Null Hypothesis that the treatment has no effect, sort of like the legal principle of “innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Significance, or Type I error probability, is our quantification of “reasonable doubt.” Type II error, on the other hand, represents the chances of letting a guilty party go free in the legal analogy. Power, the complement of Type II error, is the likelihood of detecting guilt (that is, a finding a true positive).

            Such results may:

                <li> inappropriately reduce interest in the treatment that really works, or</li>
                <li> encourage further studies in an ineffective treatment, wasting time, money, resources, and subjects. </li>

            <p>
                Now, simulate an experiment assuming the alternative is true. The significance, our <i>a priori</i> target risk for false positives, affects how we decide on a positive result and hence our chances of getting that decision correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the sample means and standard deviations, the p-value is a statistic that depends on the sample simulated. Each time you repeat an experiment, the red dots of individual outcome data, the gray bars of sample means, the black error bars, and the p-value will change. Roughly 100Xpower percent of the time, the p-value will be less than the specified significance, which has been set to 0.05 for this exercise.
