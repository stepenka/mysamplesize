            A Split Plot design is similar to Nested designs in that they show a level of hierarchy but additional represent 2 factors that are nested within a replicate (usually a individual). The replicate (or individual) is often a random effect, meaning that the experiment is not necessarily interesting the effect of the individual on the response but individual must be accounted for to reduce variation within the results.
        </p>
        <p>
            In many cases the individual would represent the 'plot' of a Split Plot design and a smaller unit of an individual (such as a tissue sample, organ, or cell) would represent the 'subplot'. Alternatively, there are also scenarios in which the individual could represent the subplot if for example, cage or litter was designated as the replicate level or plot.

            A researcher is interested in the <i>in vivo</i> effect of a drug on gene expression. Gene expression will be measured on 2 tissue samples from each of 4 subjects. Tissue samples are randomly assigned to one of two drug treatments. Each subject is considered a replicate (or the plot in split-plot theory) and the tissue sample the nested (or subplot) factor.

        <!-- Real-life example 
        <p>
            Hulshoff et al. (1996) uses a split-plot design for studying rabbit bone healing response to 
            coated implants. This study considered four types of calcium phosphate coatings for the implants.
            For each of the 18 subjects, all four coatings were implanted in both condyles of each femur, resulting in a 
            total of 72 implants.
            The implants were evaluated from subjects at three time periods (3, 6, and 9 weeks), which were randomly
            assigned to the subjects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The time periods randomly assigned are considered the whole plot treatments, 
            and the implant locations the subplot treatments.
