            A Crossover design is a variation of a Randomized Block design where time is the blocking group and treatment is applied to the experimental unit in a varying order.

        <p>
            A Crossover design is particular useful in experiments where individuals are being used to study the effect of something on a response. Live individuals can create a large source of variability that can be difficult to control for. One solution for this is to block by the individual. This may be achieved by applying different factors of a treatment to an individual at once time. For example, the response of 2 drugs applied topically to an individual is measured from two separate patches of skin on the individual. More commonly, treatments cannot be applied at the same time and so each level of treatment must be applied over a specified time period.

                This design is only viable if the treatment does not permanently change the individual in any way. Time periods between treatments must be long enough that the previous treatment cannot influence the current treatment in any way.

            A researcher is interested in the effect of 3 different drugs on a response. 3 drugs (A, B, and C) and one control (X) will be used as the treatment. To reduce variation between individuals, the individual will be blocked on and each individual will be given each treatment over the course of 4 time periods;
