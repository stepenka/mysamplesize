            Repeated Measures designs record multiple, or repeated, measurements of a response on the experimental unit. Each experimental unit is randomly assigned to one treatment and each treatment is applied and measured multiple times, with the <i>same</i> treatment(s) applied to each unit (experimental unit is usually nested within treatment). This design is appropriate for small sample sizes as it assesses how a subject responds to all treatments, subjects are their own controls.

                <p>
                    In this design the effect of time is not of interest and so time periods are treated as a random effect. This reduces error variance attributed to individual differences, resulting in more sensitivity for the treatment. For example in the graph below, instead of including each time period in your analysis like; 
                    <p>Response ~ Treatment + Time1 + Time2 + Time3 + Time4 (shown as dashed lines),</p>
                    <p>your model you can simply treat time as a random effect; <p>
                    <p>Response ~ Treatment + error(Time) (shown as green solid line)
                </p>

            Consider a study in which researchers want to determine the impact of day-to-day air pollution on subjects. Since there is variability between subjects, repeated measures observed at designated times give the ability to estimate effects on individuals;

                From <a href="http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/275/6/R1928">Harris et al., 1998</a>, 
                the effect of repeated stress on rat body weight was assessed.
                Even though we have a control group, there is a repeated measure <i>within</i> the design.
                That is, the core experimental design does not change across the levels of the repeated factor.
