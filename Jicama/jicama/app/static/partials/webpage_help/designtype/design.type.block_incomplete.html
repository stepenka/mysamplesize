            An Incomplete Block design is a block design in which every block does not have to have every treatment applied, as a Randomized Complete Block design would.
        </p>
        <p>
            This design contains one blocking factor and should be utilized when a Block design is appropriate but the resources of the experiment limit a complete design where all treatments are assigned to every block. For example, the blocking factor is litter but each litter is not the same size. This may also be appropriate when the number of treatments is large.
        </p>
        <p>
            The assignment of treatments must be made with caution. The more times that a treatment can be made within a block, the more precise the comparison will be. In a Balanced Incomplete Block design, treatments should occur equally within the blocking design. For example, in the table below each treatment (A, B, or C) occurs 3 times;

            An experiment aims to test the effect of a 4 different treatments (A, B, C, and D) on the liver. The individual subject must be used as a blocking factor. However, each liver can only be cut into 2 equal pieces for treatment and so the experiment is constrained to an Incomplete Block design (note; a Completely Randomized Block design would be able to be used if each liver could be cut into 4 so that each block could be treated with each treatment).
