        <p>A Latin Square design consists of 2 blocking factors usually structured in rows and columns.</p>
        <p>
            This design is very similar to a Randomized Block design but consists of a second blocking factor. Each blocking factor is usually a random effect and the treatment is one or more fixed effects. This is a very efficient design especially if there are many levels to each blocking factor.

            A researcher is interested in testing the effect of 4 different diets. One blocking factor will be the individual subjects to control for physical differences between subjects. The second blocking factor is diet. Each individual is given a different diet to follow for one month over the course of 4 months so that each individual is given each diet at some point.
