    "description": "The technical aspects of three-way ANOVA are not much different from those of two-way ANOVA, but the complexity and number of possible questions increases. We have main, secondary, and tertiary factors, and we may also be interested in main-secondary, main-tertiary, and secondary-tertiary interactions. Three-way also includes the possibility of a three-way (main-secondary-tertiary) interaction!"
