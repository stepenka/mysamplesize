
This code in this folder is a work in progress, with the main portion being postHocPower.py, spefically the qmvt function. R and Python match with the pmvt function, but root finding for pmvt is on hold. 

R itself doesn't use the typical "uniroot" function but something else which we need to mimic in order to make the code match.
