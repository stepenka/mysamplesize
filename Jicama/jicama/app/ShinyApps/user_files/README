Create a new database (e.g. start from a clean state) using makeDB.py, which will be called "myDB.sqlite".
Note that this name is different from the webapp default, database.sqlite, so as to not overwrite the data.

This file also has an auto-populate feature to import database for the "users" TABLE from JSON.

Unzip the information from Auth0 using 
    >> gzip -d filename.json.gz


To make a new database, open python
--- PYTHON
    >> import makeDB
    >> makeDB.makeDB()

will make the blank database

To make a database from JSON data, open Python and run
--- PYTHON
    >> import makeDB
    >> makeDB.create_DB_from_auth0_file("webmaster.json")

or whatever your filename is.
