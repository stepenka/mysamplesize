Comments:
---------

problem 4.2 should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q or another possible alternative
   is H -> I -> D -> E -> M -> Q.  Both have a total schedule path of 32.

problem 4.4 Your Gantt chart doesn't contain all of the project tasks.  You
   need to add them in to make sure they are all accounted for in your
   schedule.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

Good job!!
