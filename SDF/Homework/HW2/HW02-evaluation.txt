Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

problem 5.2 a component-based architecture would work, but for something as
   simple as tic tac toe you might not need that level of sophistication.
   Consider a monolithic architecture which would encapsulate all of the
   game functions in one application.

problem 5.6 you make a good case for the audit trail architecture.  You may
   also consider having NO database, since each drawing would be a single
   file which can be managed by the operating system.  If there is a user
   requirement to maintain a past history, then a version maintenance system
   might be implemented using the operating system as well.  Still, you have
   a good idea there!

problem 5.8 your state machine doesn't take signs into consideration.  You
   don't handle things like "-1.234e+5" or "+1.35e-1.27" which are valid
   floating point numbers.

Good job, and keep up the good work!
