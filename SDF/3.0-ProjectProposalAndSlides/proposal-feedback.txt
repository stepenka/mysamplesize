CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024

==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  It's very complete in both sections and I
   like that you are providing a design guide that walks users through the
   experiment ~ something that is sorely needed in the department since so
   few students have any idea of the statistics needed to do research, or
   even what they mean.

   The justification section is also well done, and you seem engaged and
   optimistic about getting a 'finished' product this semester.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   EXCELLENT work on the presentation.  I like the slides a lot, the color
   scheme and graphics are very eye-catching.  Very nice!

   You did an adequate job on your presenting, but you can be more effective
   as a presenter if you talk more to the audience and less to the screen or
   the projected image.  Good work in answering questions.

   Nice work overall!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
