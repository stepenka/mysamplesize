Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Nice work on the introduction section.  A diagram might be a good idea
   to aid in explanation of the parts and how they associate.
   Nothing else needed in this section.

-- Functional Requirements
   This section needs some attention, notably you need more requirements.
   An application of this magnitude should have way more than only four
   functional requirements.  You have the language right though, with the
   "shall" statements and the associated "will" statements.  You need to
   think in terms of the what you will build to facilitate the actions you
   have specified.  For example:

   IS:
   5.2.1.2. The GUI’s navigation system shall be always present for users to
            never have to backtrack to reach other sections of the site.
   SHOULD BE:
   5.2.1.2  The GUI’s navigation system shall be always present on screen.
   5.2.1.3  The GUI's navigation system shall ensure that users never have
            to backtrack to reach other sections of the site.
   5.2.1.4  The GUI's navigation system shall include shortcut keys for
            every function on the current page.
   5.2.1.5  The GUI's navigation system shall include a pop-up tool tip when
            the user hovers over a control on the page.
   5.2.1.6  The GUI's navigation system shall display ....

   ....and plenty more like this to fully specify what the GUI navigation
   system will show the user and what will happen when the user interacts.
   I hope that's clear.

-- Performance Requirements
   For this section, you need more requirements and more details.

-- Environment Requirements
   Good job on the environment section.  Nothing else for me to add, and
   nothing else needed for this section.

=============================================================================
your score:  8% out of 10% which is a B.

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes for the second submission as suggested above, including many
more requirements, and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
