            A block design aims to reduce experimental by grouping common sources of variation within experimental units (such as strain, sex, litter, or age group).
        </p>   
        <p>
            A blocked design is most appropriate when experimental units can be divided into homogeneous groups, or 'blocks', that will help to reduce the overall variability. Grouping is often a characteristic that is not necessarily of primary interest to the experiment. For example, if an experiment has 20 subjects and there is reason to believe that the effect of a treatment will be slightly different in males compared to females, gender could be a blocking factor to help reduce variability in the analysis of the results.

            A researcher is interested in testing the effectiveness of a new drug. 18 subjects are chosen to participate in a study. Due to known concerns about this drugs effectiveness on gender, the subjects are divided into 2 equal groups by gender and then each individual is randomly assigned to a treatment type; Drug A, B or C. This ensures that each blocking group is treated with each treatment.
