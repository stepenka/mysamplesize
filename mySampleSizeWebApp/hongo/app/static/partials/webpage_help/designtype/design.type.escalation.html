            Dose Escalation designs investigate the effect of a drug on a measured response by giving each subject an increasing dose level of a drug over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This design is similar to a dose response design but this design has repeated measures. In this design, all doses of a compound are given to each subject over time in an increasing non-random order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use of a continuous variable may more closely reflect the biology of an experiment making it a more appropriate design for your experimental goals than a factorial design. For example, if you are more interested in if the results show an statistically significant effect of a dose at level 3 compared to level 4 and 5 instead of if the effect of level 3 is statistically significantly different from the control. This allows a researcher to better assess the dose-response relationship instead of the effect of each dose level compared to the control.

            A researcher is interested in testing the effect of a drug on a subject. 16 subjects are divided into 4 equal cohorts. The drug is divided into 3 dosage levels and a placebo for 4 treatment levels. The latency of a physical response is measured from each subject.
