<p>
    Now, simulate an experiment assuming the alternative is true (that is there is a true difference). You can move the slider(s) on the left to change simulation parameters, and press the simulate button. Changing the slider(s) will change the power, but repeating the simulation will not. Power is a prospective parameter that depends on experiment design.

    Likewise, the underlying population 'truth,' illustrated with the horizontal lines, does not change either. What changes are the results of the experiments obtained by sampling.

    In this exercise, it is interesting to compare the gap between the mean estimates versus the width of the error bars, which track the standard deviation. The horizontal truth lines are at a fixed distance apart, and that distance represents 'signal.' To estimate the signal, we subtract the two bar heights, and the noise level is the error bar width.

    Like the sample means and standard deviations, the p-value is a statistic that depends on the sample simulated. Each time you repeat an experiment, the red dots of individual outcome data, the gray bars of sample means, the black error bars, and the p-value will change. Roughly 100Xpower percent of the time, the p-value will be less than the specified significance, which has been set to 0.05 for this exercise.

    You can repeat the simulation as often as you like.
