            A three-way ANOVA test is a statistical test to compare a single outcome measure that is collected in the presence of three distinct factors. Factors can represent treatments (with settings chosen by the experimenter) or other biological properties like sex or age.

            The technical aspects of three-way ANOVA are not much different from those of two-way ANOVA, but the complexity and number of possible questions increases.  We have main, secondary, and tertiary factors, and we may also be interested in main-secondary, main-tertiary, and secondary-tertiary interactions.  Three-way also includes the possibility of a three-way (main-secondary-tertiary) interaction!
