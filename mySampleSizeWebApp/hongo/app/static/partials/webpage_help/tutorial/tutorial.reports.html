            The reporting tools are designed to simplify the documentation process. We recapture summary reports generated in DESIGN GUIDE and TOOLS. The ARRIVE Supplement Form is a comprehensive form that encompasses all of the necessary information about your Experimental Design and Methods so that your study can be easily replicated and understood by others. If you have filled out the Design Guide, some information will be automatically propagated to the Supplement form so that redundant information does not have to be entered. This form is intended to be used as a supplement to documentation or publications but may also be a useful guide for researchers to ensure that all necessary and good practices were followed throughout the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
            A checklist version of the ARRIVE Supplement form is also available to assist researchers throughout the design process as a quick reference to ensure that all methods are on track.
        </p>
        <p>
            A User Database allows researchers to save working projects or past results for future reference.
