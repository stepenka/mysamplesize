        <p>
            The Design Guide is a step-through guide to help you decide which experimental design and statistical method is most appropriate for your study. Enter in your study information and the Design Guide will suggest an Experimental Design and Statistical Test that is most suited to the details entered as well as any alternatives that may possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Embedded in the Design Guide is also a section on calculating Statistical Power and Sample Size based on your inputs. If the Statistical Power and/or Sample Size calculated are not feasible or sufficient for your study, you may need to modify the information to meet your experimental needs.
