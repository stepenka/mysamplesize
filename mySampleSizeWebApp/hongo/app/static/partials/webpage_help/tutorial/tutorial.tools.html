        <p><b>Tools verifies your design is statistically valid and reasonable for your needs.</b></p>
        <p>
            Once you have determined an appropriate Experimental Design for your study, an estimation of the Statistical Power of the results should always be calculated. It is important to calculate Statistical Power before collecting data in order to ensure that the Experimental Design will yield results that have sufficient ability to detect effect sizes. If the estimate of Statistical Power calculated is too low to suit your experimental needs, you can always try to increase Sample Size or alternatively, reconsider your Experimental Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            To learn more about Statistical Power and why it is important, see <power></power> in the Statistical Basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            We offer a variety of tools to assist you in refining your Design Type Choice. The Power Size Calculator, the Sample Size Calculator and the Power Plot all are different ways of understanding the Statistical Power of your design. The Statistical Power calculator allows you to calculate Statistical Power when there is a known Sample Size and Effect Size. Similarly, the Sample Size Calculator allows you to calculate Sample Size when there is a known Statistical Power and Effect Size. The Power Plots allow you to visualize the trade offs of Statistical Power across a range of given Sample and Effect Sizes. The Random Number Generator can be used once a Design Type has been finalized. This tools allows you to choose between several different Design Types and then generate random numbers to assist you in assigning treatments to subjects randomly.

            A help center is available to help understand the variables used and help icons in the calculators assist with the calculation of variables.

            Each statistical tool, except for RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, offers choices for type of statistical test for analysis.

                            <strong>Our Case Study</strong> a 1-Way ANOVA was used with 4 groups and a significance level of 0.05. It was known that a Statistical Power of at least 0.8 and an Effect Size of at least 75 was required. The results show that Sample Size = 12 Subjects per Group would be necessary to achieve this level of Statistical Power and Effect Size.
