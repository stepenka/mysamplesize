        <p>
            How big of an effect do you think your treatment will have over the control? This number represents an "aspirational positive" or the positive you think you might be able to attain. Look at pilot or similar studies, comparing the outcome measure estimates from the control and treatment. If you are using a pilot study, you may want to use that data directly. If the previous experiments are similar but not directly comparable, use your judgment.
            <br> <br>
            The number you specify will be used as an upper bound on effect sizes so you can see the impact of effect size on sample size.
            <br> <br>
            If you have prior knowledge from a pilot study or the literature, please use that information here. If you have no prior experience, then use your best judgment.

            To gain some feeling for the design process, you may want to simulate a simple experiment.  At this link, you can simulate a two-group or a multi-group comparison experiment to see how effect size, standard deviation, sample size per group, and significance govern statistical power and relate to your ability to detect underlying differences between your groups.
