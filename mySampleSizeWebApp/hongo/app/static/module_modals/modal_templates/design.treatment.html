            You may have different types of treatments and manipulations, such as in an agonist-antagonist interaction study, or an injury-treatment study. If you have distinct treatment types (like injury and therapeutic treatment), you can add treatments here. Each of these treatments may have one or more settings (again, different dose levels of a drug is an example), and they may have different experimental controls. 
            <br><br>
            It is also possible that a study will not have any treatments. Observational studies, for example, do not manipulate experimental test subjects; rather, the subjects are measured under differing but not experimentally-controlled circumstances. Typically, these differing circumstances would be categorized as factors or covariates rather than treatments or manipulations, and they would be entered on the next tab. In that case, you can remove all treatments using the [X] button to the right.
