    <h5>
        The observational unit is the smallest unit that a response will be measured from.
        This is often the same as the experimental unit.
    </h5>
    
    <p>For example: </p>
    <p>
        You are studying the effect of a drug on a person over 3 days. The person is the experimental unit 
        but the measurement of the effect of the drug taken each day is the observational unit. 
        In this scenario, each person would yield 3 observational units.
