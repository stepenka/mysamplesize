        Treatments are factors an experimentalist specifies to examine a scientific hypothesis. You may have a single treatment setting to compare to an experimental control group, or you may have several treatment settings. If your treatment has multiple settings, for example a low dose and a high dose, or short, medium, and long exposure times, list each treatment setting. The number of treatment settings will impact the number of groups in your experiment, so you will need to think carefully about how many settings you need. Pilot studies are important for sorting out appropriate treatment settings.
        <br><br>
        We also provide a separate place in this form for your control. Do not enter the control as a "zero" treatment setting: instead, enter information on your control in the form boxes to the right, choosing the appropriate type from the pull-down menu and providing a descriptive name (saline vehicle or sham surgery, for example).
        <br><br>
        For each distinct treatment, the number of levels will be determined as the number of settings plus one for the control. We purposefully use the word "setting" for treatment factor specifications, to distinguish from the more general word "level" that denotes differences among subjects in terms of a factor.
        <br><br>
        If you have multiple types of treatments, and you are interested in their interactions, say an agonist-antagonist interaction, you may want to use the Add Treatment button to include a second (or third) treatment to your experiment. MySampleSize will help you create a factorial design with groups of subjects receiving treatment levels of each type of treatment, for a full examination of your manipulations and their interactions.
        <br><br>
        Another possible experiment you might be considering is the direct comparison of two distinct treatments in a head-to-head comparison, rather than an interaction study. In this case, your study will actually have just one "treatment," with the settings representing the distinct treatments that you want to compare. For example, if you want to compare a new cancer drug to a previously studied one, your treatment will be "Cancer drugs," with settings "My New Idea" and "The Old Tired Drug," with a vehicle or other control group as appropriate.
