        <p>
            Sometimes called “measurement error,” this is the amount of variability you expect to see when repeating measurements within each given subject.
            <br /> <br />
            The sum of squares of within-subject standard deviation and between-subject standard deviation would be the square of the standard deviation for a study with only one time point per subject.
