    "description": "You may be familiar with Cohen’s effect sizes (Cohen, 1988), especially Cohen’s d for t-tests and Cohen’s f for ANOVAs. These quantities are relative effect sizes: roughly speaking, Cohen’s d and f values correspond to the ratios of effect size to outcome standard deviation for T-test and ANOVA test, respectively."
