    "description": "ANOVA not only allows for more than two groups of subjects to be compared, you can also look at multiple factors simultaneously. That is, you can apply two different treatments, each with its own control and dosage settings. Alternatively, you can apply a treatment and examine the differences in response for male and female subjects."
