    "description": "Once youâ€™ve decided on treatments and settings, factors, and outcome measures to explore your scientific conjecture, the appropriate number of subjects is the crucial remaining decision. One way to select and support a choice on the number of subjects involves prospective statistical consideration of power and significance. There are four key quantities you need for this process: significance, power, outcome standard deviation, and effect size."
