    "description": "A group in an experiment is a collection of subjects that are identical except only for subject-to-subject variation. Each subject in the group receives the exact same treatment setting (or control). Each subject in the group has the same non-treatment factor level. The number of subjects in each group is the quantity one seeks when determining sample size. The total number of subjects is then the number of subjects per group times the number of groups."
