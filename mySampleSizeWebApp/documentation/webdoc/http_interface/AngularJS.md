AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

AngularJS is a client side JavaScript MVC framework to develop a dynamic web application. AngularJS was originally started as a project in Google but now, it is open source framework.

AngularJS is entirely based on HTML and JavaScript, so there is no need to learn another syntax or language.

AngularJS changes static HTML to dynamic HTML. It extends the ability of HTML by adding built-in attributes and components and also provides an ability to create custom attributes using simple JavaScript. 

The following table lists all the important concepts in AngularJS. 

| Concept  | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Template | HTML with additional markup |
| Directives | Extends the HTML with custom attributes and elements |
| Model | The data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts |
| Scope | A context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it |
| Expressions | Executes JavaScript code inside brackets {{ }} |
| Compiler | Parses the template and instantiates directives and expressions |
| Filter | Formats the value of an expression for display to the user |
| View | what the user sees (the DOM) |
| Data | Binding 	Sync data between the model and the view |
| Controller | Maintains the application data and business logic |
| Module | a container for different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, directives which configure the Injector |
| Service | Reusable business logic, independent of views |
| Dependency Injection | Creates and wires objects and functions |
| Injector | Dependency injection container  |
